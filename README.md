# Period_Tracker
A simple web-based period / menstrual cycle tracker built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
This project helps users approximate and visualize their period cycles.

## Features

- Input your last period start date and average cycle length  
- Calculates estimated next period start date  
- Provides visual cues or alerts (via UI)  
- Simple and easy-to-use interface  
- No backend required (runs fully in browser)

  ## How It Works

1. The user enters the start date of their last period and optionally the average cycle length (in days).  
2. JavaScript computes the next expected period date by adding the cycle length to the last date.  
3. The result is displayed on the page, possibly with a message indicating when the next period is expected.
